# CMake Boilerplate

A simple CMake boilerplate.
Have a look at the tutorial [Medium](https://link.medium.com/jzauQXj0A8).

## CMake

The configuration of CMake is in the `CMakeLists.txt` file in the root folder.

## Code formatter

Use of [ClangFormat](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html). The style 
options are defined in the `.clang-format` file. For more details have a look 
at the [the official Style Options](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormatStyleOptions.html).
